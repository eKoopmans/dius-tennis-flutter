# dius_tennis_flutter

This module implements the DiUS tennis coding test in Flutter - for learning!

## Getting Started

To run this project, first clone the repo:

```
mkdir dius-tennis-flutter
cd dius-tennis-flutter
git clone https://github.com/eKoopmans/dius-tennis-flutter.git .
```

Then run via the command line or VS Code.
Note that this project requires the Flutter SDK to be installed - see [Flutter Getting Started](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) for more info.

## Features

This project has two buttons which allow you to award points to Player 1 or Player 2, and displays the current Game, Set, and Match scores.
There is also a reset button at the bottom to reset all scores.

There is still lots of room for improvement:

- Adding test cases (None implemented in Flutter)
- Having an intro screen that allows you to enter the players' names
- Responsive sizing and styling
- Fun animations
